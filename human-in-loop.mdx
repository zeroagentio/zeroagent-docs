The Human-In-Loop feature allows users to add an extra layer of control over automated tasks executed by the AI Agent. This enables manual oversight and approval for actions performed on integrated business apps.

## How it Works

1. **⚙️ Toggle Human-In-Loop On:** Activate the feature in your ZeroAgent settings.
2. **🚀 Perform an Action:** Initiate an action on a connected business app (e.g., create a GitHub repository).
3. **📝 Approval Prompt:** ZeroAgent displays the action details for your review and approval.
4. **✅ Approve or ❌ Reject:** Confirm or reject the action.
5. **🔄 Action Execution:** Upon approval, ZeroAgent executes the action.
