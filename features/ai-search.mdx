Zeroagentâ€™s AI-powered Product Search revolutionizes how customers discover products by learning their preferences, behavior, and shopping patterns. Instead of relying on generic search results, the AI assistant provides personalized product recommendations that align with each customerâ€™s unique needs.

## How It Works
1. **Understanding Customer Preferences**:
The AI assistant continuously learns from past searches, purchases, browsing behavior, and interactions to build a detailed profile of each customer.

2. **Smart Product Suggestions**:
Using machine learning models, the assistant suggests products that align with customer preferences, ensuring they find what they need faster.

3. **Conversational Product Discovery**:
Customers can ask natural language queries (e.g., `"Show me trending sneakers under $100"`), and the assistant intelligently refines results based on context.

4. **Adaptive Learning:**
Over time, the assistant refines and improves recommendations based on ongoing customer interactions, making suggestions more relevant.
