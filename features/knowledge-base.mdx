You can add content to the Knowledge Base in the following ways:

## 1. 🛍️ Shopify Store Integration

If your store is built on **Shopify**, the system automatically adds all your products to the AI Knowledge Base. This ensures that product details are readily available for the AI to answer customer queries effectively.

> No additional setup is required for Shopify store owners.

## 2. 📄 Files

You can upload files to enrich your AI Knowledge Base with additional data. Supported formats include:

- **PDF**: Add documents containing FAQs, product manuals, or other relevant information.
- **XLS**: Use the specified format to add detailed product information to the AI Knowledge Base.

- **CSV**: Upload structured data to expand your AI’s knowledge about your store and services.
